This model predicts if a machine will fail within 7 days, using sensor readings. The point of
the lab isn't the model itself — it's making sure anyone can clone this repo and get the exact
same result I got.

## How to run it

You need Docker, git, and make. Nothing else — no Python setup, no cloud login.

```bash
make reproduce
```

expected test_roc_auc: 0.8482 ± 0.0010

Check the result matches:

```bash
make verify
```

Takes about 3–4 minutes the first time (building the image), then ~10 seconds after that.

## What's in the data

240 machines, 25 readings each, 6 sensor features. Target is whether the machine fails within
7 days (about 12% of rows are a "yes"). Data is fake/generated (`scripts/make_dataset.py`), and
tracked with DVC so the exact version is recorded, not just the file.

One important thing: I split train/val/test **by machine**, not by row. If rows from the same
machine end up in both train and test, the model can basically cheat by recognizing the machine
instead of actually learning anything. There's a test for this in `tests/test_data.py`.

## Why ± 0.0010

I ran the same seed twice — got the exact same number both times. Ran it on a different CPU
(arm64 vs amd64) — difference was 0.000013. Then I changed the seed across 5 runs and the score
moved by as much as 0.05. So 0.0010 is generous enough to cover small CPU differences, but way
too tight to hide an actual bug like a missing seed.

---

## Runs I tracked

Did 10 runs total, logged in MLflow with params, both val/test scores, commit hash, and the
data version:

- 5 runs changing `max_depth` (3, 5, 8, 12, 16) — deeper trees start overfitting, best was depth 5
- 5 runs changing only the seed — scores ranged from 0.823 to 0.873, which is where the ± above
  comes from

---

## If I had to drop one thing (hashes / digest pin / seed)

I'd drop the hashes first. The version numbers (`==`) already lock which package version gets
installed — hashes just add protection against a file getting swapped out, which is rare. Losing
the digest pin or the seed breaks things way more often: the base image gets rebuilt without any
commit from me, and without a fixed seed my score bounces around by 0.05, way more than my
tolerance.

## Notes

- `make reproduce` only needs Docker — it builds the data and trains inside the container, so it
  doesn't depend on your machine's Python at all.
- Image is pushed to Artifact Registry, digest-pinned. `dvc push` is done, remote is a private
  bucket (grader would need read access to `dvc pull`, but that's not needed for `make reproduce`).
- `make teardown` isn't implemented yet — that's expected, it's a Lab 5 thing.
